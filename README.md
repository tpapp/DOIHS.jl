Package for some routines and examples used in the Dynamic Optimization 2 course at the Institute for Advanced Studies, Vienna, in 2017 spring.

The code is mostly pedagogical, and not optimized for either speed, allocation, or even numerical accuracy. This package is abandoned, useful parts are being reorganized into other libraries of mine.
